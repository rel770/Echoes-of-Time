        <article id="ben-gurion">
          <h3>David Ben-Gurion (1886-1973)</h3>
          <p>
            Known as the "Father of the Nation," David Ben-Gurion was Israel's primary founding father and
            first Prime Minister. Born David Gr√ºn in Poland, he immigrated to Palestine in 1906 during the
            Second Aliyah and quickly became involved in labor politics and Zionist activism.
          </p>

          <p>
            As chairman of the Jewish Agency from 1935 to 1948, Ben-Gurion led the political struggle for
            independence. He was instrumental in building the Haganah defense force, managing relationships
            with world powers, and making the crucial decisions that led to statehood. His famous declaration
            of independence on May 14, 1948, marked the culmination of his life's work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ben-Gurion's vision extended beyond mere political independence. He dreamed of a modern,
            democratic state that would serve as a "light unto the nations" while ingathering Jewish exiles
            from around the world. His leadership during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and his role in
            establishing Israel's institutions made him the most significant figure in the country's early
            history.

                Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants;
                it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel."

        <!-- Chaim Weizmann -->
        <article id="weizmann">
          <h3>Chaim Weizmann (1874-1952)</h3>
          <p>
            A brilliant chemist and skilled diplomat, Chaim Weizmann served as Israel's first President and
            played a crucial role in securing international support for the Jewish state. Born in Russia and
            educated in Germany and Switzerland, Weizmann combined scientific achievement with political
            acumen in his service to the Zionist cause.
          </p>

          <p>
            Weizmann's scientific work proved invaluable during World War I when his development of synthetic
            acetone helped the British war effort. This contribution opened doors to British political circles
            and helped pave the way for the Balfour Declaration, which Weizmann helped secure through his
            diplomatic efforts.
          </p>

          <p>
            As President of the World Zionist Organization from 1920 to 1931 and again from 1935 to 1946,
            Weizmann was the international face of the Zionist movement. His moderate approach and ability to
            work with world leaders made him an effective advocate for Jewish statehood on the global stage.
          </p>

        <!-- Moshe Sharett -->
        <article id="sharett">
          <h3>Moshe Sharett (1894-1965)</h3>
          <p>Israel's first Foreign Minister and second Prime Minister, Moshe Sharett was a master diplomat who helped establish Israel's place in the international community. Born in Ukraine and raised in Palestine, Sharett was fluent in multiple languages and possessed a deep understanding of Middle Eastern politics.</p>
          
          <p>As head of the Jewish Agency's Political Department from 1933 to 1948, Sharett conducted crucial negotiations with British officials and international leaders. His diplomatic skills were essential in building support for the UN Partition Plan and securing recognition for the new state.</p>
          
          <p>Sharett believed in moderate policies and diplomatic solutions, sometimes putting him at odds with Ben-Gurion's more assertive approach. His commitment to international law and peaceful coexistence represented an important voice in Israel's early foreign policy debates.</p>

Born in Kibbutz Degania, Dayan lost his left eye during a reconnaissance mission with British forces in 1941, giving him his distinctive eye patch.</p>
          
          <p>During the 1948 war, Dayan commanded the Jordan Valley sector and later became a symbol of Israeli military prowess. His tactical innovations and bold leadership style made him a legendary figure in Israeli military history.</p>

As a member of the Jewish Agency Executive, she was one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence and the only woman among the founding fathers of Israel.</p>
          
          <p>Meir's fundraising efforts in the United States during the crucial months of 1948 helped secure the resources needed for the new state's survival. Her famous quote, "We have no choice but to be strong," embodied the spirit of determination that characterized Israel's founders.</p>
