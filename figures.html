          <h3>David Ben-Gurion (1886-1973)</h3>
          <p>
            Known as the "Father of the Nation," David Ben-Gurion was Israel's primary founding father and
            first Prime Minister. Born David Gr√ºn in Poland, he immigrated to Palestine in 1906 during the
            Second Aliyah and quickly became involved in labor politics and Zionist activism.
          </p>

          <p>
            As chairman of the Jewish Agency from 1935 to 1948, Ben-Gurion led the political struggle for
            independence. He was instrumental in building the Haganah defense force, managing relationships
            with world powers, and making the crucial decisions that led to statehood. His famous declaration
            of independence on May 14, 1948, marked the culmination of his life's work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ben-Gurion's vision extended beyond mere political independence. He dreamed of a modern,
            democratic state that would serve as a "light unto the nations" while ingathering Jewish exiles
            from around the world. His leadership during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and his role in
            establishing Israel's institutions made him the most significant figure in the country's early
            history.

                "The State of Israel will be open for Jewish immigration and for the Ingathering of the
                Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants;
                it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel."

        <!-- Chaim Weizmann -->
        <article id="weizmann">
          <h3>Chaim Weizmann (1874-1952)</h3>
          <p>
            A brilliant chemist and skilled diplomat, Chaim Weizmann served as Israel's first President and
            played a crucial role in securing international support for the Jewish state. Born in Russia and
            educated in Germany and Switzerland, Weizmann combined scientific achievement with political
            acumen in his service to the Zionist cause.
          </p>

          <p>
            Weizmann's scientific work proved invaluable during World War I when his development of synthetic
            acetone helped the British war effort. This contribution opened doors to British political circles
            and helped pave the way for the Balfour Declaration, which Weizmann helped secure through his
            diplomatic efforts.
          </p>

          <p>
            As President of the World Zionist Organization from 1920 to 1931 and again from 1935 to 1946,
            Weizmann was the international face of the Zionist movement. His moderate approach and ability to
            work with world leaders made him an effective advocate for Jewish statehood on the global stage.
