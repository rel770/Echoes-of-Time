                <h3>David Ben-Gurion (1886-1973)</h3>
                <p>Known as the "Father of the Nation," David Ben-Gurion was Israel's primary founding father and first Prime Minister. Born David Gr√ºn in Poland, he immigrated to Palestine in 1906 during the Second Aliyah and quickly became involved in labor politics and Zionist activism.</p>
                
                <p>As chairman of the Jewish Agency from 1935 to 1948, Ben-Gurion led the political struggle for independence. He was instrumental in building the Haganah defense force, managing relationships with world powers, and making the crucial decisions that led to statehood. His famous declaration of independence on May 14, 1948, marked the culmination of his life's work.</p>
                
                <p>Ben-Gurion's vision extended beyond mere political independence. He dreamed of a modern, democratic state that would serve as a "light unto the nations" while ingathering Jewish exiles from around the world. His leadership during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and his role in establishing Israel's institutions made him the most significant figure in the country's early history.</p>
