            <h2>The Path to Statehood</h2>
            <p>The establishment of Israel on May 14, 1948, was not a sudden event but the culmination of decades of struggle, diplomacy, and determination. The road to independence began long before that historic day, rooted in the Zionist movement of the late 19th century and accelerated by the tragedies and opportunities of the 20th century.</p>
            
            <p>From the Balfour Declaration of 1917 to the UN Partition Plan of 1947, each milestone brought the Jewish people closer to their ancient dream of returning to their homeland. The British Mandate period saw waves of immigration, the building of institutions, and growing tensions that would ultimately lead to the birth of a nation.</p>
            
            <p>This page explores the key events, decisions, and circumstances that made Israeli independence possible, showing how history, politics, and human determination converged on that fateful spring day in 1948.</p>

                <h3>Early Zionism (1897-1917)</h3>
                <p>The foundations of modern Israel were laid in the late 19th century with the rise of political Zionism. Theodor Herzl's vision of a Jewish state gained momentum through the First Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland, in 1897. This movement responded to rising antisemitism in Europe and the desire for Jewish self-determination.</p>
                
                <p>The First Aliyah (1882-1903) and Second Aliyah (1904-1914) brought waves of Jewish immigrants to Ottoman Palestine. These pioneers established agricultural settlements, revived Hebrew as a spoken language, and began building the infrastructure of what would become Israel.</p>
                
                <p>World War I created new opportunities. The Balfour Declaration of November 2, 1917, represented the first major international recognition of Jewish aspirations for a homeland in Palestine. British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour declared that the British government viewed "with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people."</p>

            <!-- British Mandate period -->
            <article id="mandate-period">
                <h3>British Mandate (1920-1947)</h3>
                <p>The League of Nations granted Britain the Mandate for Palestine in 1920, formally recognizing the British commitment to establish a Jewish national home. The mandate period saw remarkable growth in the Jewish community, known as the Yishuv, from about 85,000 in 1922 to over 600,000 by 1947.</p>
                
                <p>The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Aliyahs brought diverse groups of immigrants, including refugees from Eastern European pogroms and later from Nazi persecution. These immigrants built cities like Tel Aviv, established the Hebrew University, created labor organizations, and developed agricultural techniques that made the desert bloom.</p>
                
                <p>However, the period was also marked by growing Arab-Jewish tensions and British restrictions on Jewish immigration. The 1939 White Paper severely limited Jewish immigration just as the Holocaust was beginning, creating a crisis that would shape the final years of the mandate.</p>
                
                <p>World War II proved to be a turning point. While 30,000 Jews from Palestine served in the British forces, the Holocaust demonstrated the urgent need for a Jewish state. The discovery of the full extent of Nazi atrocities gave new moral force to Zionist claims and international sympathy for Jewish statehood.</p>

                <h3>The Final Year (1947-1948)</h3>
                <p>The decisive year began with Britain's announcement in February 1947 that it would end the mandate and turn the Palestine question over to the United Nations. This decision came after years of conflict, including armed resistance by Jewish underground groups and the British inability to find a solution acceptable to both Jews and Arabs.</p>
                
                <p>The UN Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) recommended partition, leading to the historic vote on November 29, 1947. UN Resolution 181 passed with 33 votes in favor, 13 against, and 10 abstentions, partitioning Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states with Jerusalem under international control.</p>
                
                <p>The period between the UN vote and the end of the mandate was marked by increasing violence and the beginning of what would become the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Despite the challenges, Jewish leaders prepared for statehood, establishing provisional government institutions and military forces.</p>
                
                <p>As the British mandate officially ended at midnight on May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel at the Tel Aviv Museum. Within hours, the United States and Soviet Union recognized the new state, marking the successful conclusion of the long road to independence.</p>
