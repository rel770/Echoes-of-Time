            <h2>The Path to Statehood</h2>
            <p>The establishment of Israel on May 14, 1948, was not a sudden event but the culmination of decades of struggle, diplomacy, and determination. The road to independence began long before that historic day, rooted in the Zionist movement of the late 19th century and accelerated by the tragedies and opportunities of the 20th century.</p>
            
            <p>From the Balfour Declaration of 1917 to the UN Partition Plan of 1947, each milestone brought the Jewish people closer to their ancient dream of returning to their homeland. The British Mandate period saw waves of immigration, the building of institutions, and growing tensions that would ultimately lead to the birth of a nation.</p>
            
            <p>This page explores the key events, decisions, and circumstances that made Israeli independence possible, showing how history, politics, and human determination converged on that fateful spring day in 1948.</p>
