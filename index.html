        <p>
          On May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel, marking the
          end of nearly 2,000 years of Jewish diaspora and the beginning of a new chapter in Middle Eastern
          history. This moment came after decades of struggle, hope, and determination.

          This digital exhibition takes you through four crucial aspects of Israel's independence story.
          You'll discover the historical events that led to statehood, meet the key figures who shaped this
          momentous period, explore the artifacts that tell this story, and understand its lasting impact on
          the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The declaration may have taken just a few minutes to read, but its echoes continue to resonate
          through time, representing the fulfillment of an ancient dream and the beginning of modern Israel.
