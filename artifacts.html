        <h2>Preserving History Through Objects</h2>
        <p>
          The story of Israel's independence lives not only in books and memories, but also in the physical
          objects, documents, and artifacts that have survived from that extraordinary period. These tangible
          pieces of history connect us directly to the events and people who shaped the nation's birth.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the original Declaration of Independence scroll to personal items belonging to the founding
          fathers, from military equipment used in the 1948 war to everyday objects from the early days of
          statehood, these artifacts provide an intimate window into Israel's founding era.
        </p>

        <p>
          This collection showcases some of the most significant artifacts from Israel's independence period,
          housed in museums and private collections around the world. Each item tells a unique story and helps
          us understand the human experience behind the historical events.

          <h3>The Declaration of Independence Scroll</h3>
          <p>
            The most important artifact of Israel's independence is the original scroll of the Declaration of
            Independence, handwritten in Hebrew and signed by 37 leaders on May 14, 1948. This parchment
            document, carefully preserved in the Israel State Archives, represents the formal birth
            certificate of the modern State of Israel.

                The scroll was handwritten by Moshe Kol using a special calligraphy pen. The parchment was
                imported from Europe specifically for this purpose. Due to time constraints, only 37 of the
                intended 51 members of the Provisional Council were able to sign on that historic day.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scroll measures 52 cm wide and 38 cm high, and is written entirely in Hebrew using
                traditional Jewish scribal techniques.

          <h3>The First Israeli Flag</h3>
          <p>
            The flag that flew over the Tel Aviv Museum during the independence ceremony was one of the first
            official Israeli flags. Based on the design of the Zionist flag created in 1891, it features the
            blue Star of David between two blue stripes on a white background.
